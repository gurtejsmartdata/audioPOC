## Start

To setup project , clone project and run following command in root folder  :

```bash

$ yarn

```

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn <platform>` to run the _platform_ application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)
